/*

Create a Java program that will store 10 student objects in an ArrayList, ArrayList<Student>. 
A student object consists of the following fields:

int rollno
String name
String address

Implement a comparator class to sort student objects by rollno (roll number). 
Implement your own merge sort method and place your code in a separate Java source file. 
Do not use a sort method from the Java collections library.
